=head1 NAME

Collision::2D::Collision - An object representing a collision betwixt 2 entities

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item time

The time of collision. For example, consider a point-circle collision,
where the point is moving towards the circle.
$collision->time is the B<exact> moment of collision between the two.

=item axis

The axis of collision. Basically a vector from one entity to the other.
It depends entirely on how they collide.

If the collision involves a vertical or horizontal line, the axis will be
'x' or 'y'. If it's between a point or corner and a circle, it will be
an arrayref, of the form [$x,$y].

This vector will not be normal (normal means of length 1).
L<Collision::2D::normalize_vec($v)|Collision::2D/normalize_vec>
is provided for that purpose.

=item vaxis

Again, the axis of collision. If you call this, it will always return the vector
form [$x,$y]. If the axis existed as 'x' or 'y', it is translated to [$x,$y].

This vector will not be normal (normal means of length 1).
L<Collision::2D::normalize_vec($v)|Collision::2D/normalize_vec>
is provided for that purpose.

=item ent1, ent2

 $collision->ent1

This is to provide some context for L</axis>. This is useful because
dynamic_collision doesn't preserve the order of your entities. If you would
like for the order to be preserved, use the C<< entity->collide($ent2) >> method,
or use the keep_order parameter in C<dynamic_collision>.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item bounce_vector

 my $bouncevec = $co->bounce_vector (elasticity => .8);

Assuming that C<< $co->ent2 >> has infinite mass, the C<< $co->bounce_vector >> is
the resulting velocity of C<< $co->ent1 >>. The elasticity parameter is 1 by default.

=item invert

my $other_collision = $self->invert();

This returns the inverse of this collision. That is, the time remains,
but ent1 and ent2 are swapped, and the axis is inversed. This does not effect $self.
